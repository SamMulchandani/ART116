          <h1>Spanish Vacation</h1>
        <p id="paragraph1">Last summer, in 2024, my friend from France came to the United States to visit and immerse himself in American culture for two weeks. This past summer of 2025, I went to Reims, France to visit him for a week. <br> 
        After France, I immediately headed to rural Madrid, Spain, to do another cultural exchange for two weeks with a Spanish family with a boy my age named Gonzalo. Then, Gonzalo and I came back to the U.S. and he stayed with my family for another two weeks.</p>

          <img id="img2" src="travel-images/vacation2.png" width="309" height="373" alt="A man standing with his jacket outstretched in front of him as he stands facing, and directly opposite, a bull that looks ready to charge. They stand solo in the street with water flowing down the middle from another bull bathing in the background. A crowd watches from behind bars."/>

        <p id="paragraph2">  <br>
          I have been learning Spanish in school since the eighth grade–even taking the highest level Spanish that my high school offers now (IB Spanish HL)–and have progressed to the point of fluency this past year. I was very excited to be able to show off my language skills in a native environment, while furthering my cultural understanding and breadth. <br>
           I learned a lot in Europe, from knowledge of Spanish culture and geography to the complex history of all of Spain’s kings and queens. Most importantly, however, I made friends for life.
